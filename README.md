# Good-Pitchers-Average-Pitches

#### Inspiration: 
I got inspired to pursue this project when I was messing around on mlb's statcast search tool, and I was looking at the starting pitchers with the lowest fastball velocities. I happened to stumble across Kyle Hendricks, a pitcher I knew is notorious for having a slow fastball. As expected, I found that his average fastball was a measly 87 mph. However, I was shocked to see that Hendricks was actually one of the best starting pitchers in 2023, and I especially noticed that he was excellent at limiting hard contact (nearly leads the league in several of the barrel/hard contact statistics). Thus, I wanted to find out how Hendricks is able to succeed in an era dominated by 100 mph fastballs and 90 mph sweepers. To that end, I also wanted to generalize and find other pitchers with not just subpar fastballs manage to succeed, but also pitchers with other average/sub-par pitches. 

#### Goal:
Planning a new project idea which looks at MLB pitchers with average "stuff" (average velocity, average movement on their pitches) that still have great success against the best hitters in the world and find out why. 

#### Current hypothesis/thinking:
Current hypothesis is that their pitches complement each other (play well off of each other/move in different directions), mix their pitches well (optimal pitch usage) and locate well, or a combination of the three.
